# IDSnipe
Easy ID sniping in Geometry Dash.
# How to use?
Download the .exe or .py script and create a file "config.dat" in the same directory as the script. Write the settings in this format: 
username;password;levelname1;levelname2;levelname3;levelname4;levelname5;snipedID  
Then, run the script and press ENTER to start sniping IDs. I recommend to run this about approximately 20 seconds before the level ID you want is reached. If you leave it running, there is a chance your IP will be banned from the servers because of fast most recent ID fetching in a short time.
# How does it work?
The script uploads 5 levels in a short period of time 5 IDs before the specified ID. You can of course change the ID delay. Your username and password are not stored, they are used only to upload levels.
